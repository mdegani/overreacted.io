This repo is a fork of Dan Abramov's blog.  Here are some of the reasons I forked it and am now messing around with it:

1. Gatsby is cool.
1. I work with React and I like programming React.
1. Since Dan is using this for his own blog, he's already done a lot of the hard work. Thanks goes to him for sharing the code!
1. I've always wanted an excuse to write a blog.
