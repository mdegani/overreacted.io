# fork of [overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io/) by Dan Abramov

I saw this tweet and decided I'd give it a go: https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1096937152619925504.

Forked from [Gatsby blog starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog). Syntax theme based on [Sarah Drasner's Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme/) with small tweaks.

To run locally, `yarn`, then `yarn dev`, then open https://localhost:8000.
